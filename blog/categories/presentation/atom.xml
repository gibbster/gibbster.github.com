    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the last year, I've been hosting the occasional Tech Talk at my company.
The idea was that we all deal with 'unknown unknowns' in our job, and often
hear about useful tools and techniques through pure serendipity (read: Hacker
News). Since we're working on similar kinds of projects, sharing these tips
isn't just interesting but can really increase productivity.</p>

<p>The most recent presentation I created was one on Varnish with Edge Side
Includes. ESI is a really cool idea for combining mostly static pages with
segments that need to personalized or that rapidly change.</p>

<p>Part of the reason I through this set together as a set of slide, I'll admit,
is just so I could have a chance to play with the new
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/io-2012-slides/">Google io 2012 slide templates</a>.
I usually just do a live coding session.</p>

<p>The (simple) code is <a href="https://github.com/gibbster/varnish-esi-presentation">on github.</a>
I put the <a href="http://gibbster.github.com/varnish-esi-presentation/slides/">slides on the gh-pages for the project.</a></p>
